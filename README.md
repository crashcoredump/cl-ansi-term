# cl-ansi-term

*Please note that this work is in progress and it's not usable yet.*

This library allows to format text so that it will appear on ANSI-compliant
terminals colorized and/or stylized.

cl-ansi-term uses level of abstraction for this job: you can create
'style-sheet' that contains as many entries as you want. Then you can format
text with handy API.

Style sheets allow specify not only colors, effects, and styles, but also
fill-columns and other things for nice terminal output.

## Installation
